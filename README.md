# clmul_nb
Branchless CLMUL library.

The purpose of this library is to provide a low-level, branchless CLMUL (carry-less multiplication) implementation for architecture which does not support hardware acceleration of cryptographic operations. It is intended as a teaching aid and should be carefully tested before use in production code.
